## Backstory

Prior to Software Engineering, I worked in nonprofits at various institutions such as the United Nations, a small organization aimed at empowering women and girls worldwide, and - most recently - a national refugee resettlement agency, as a Program Officer. Across these experiences, I was inspired by the ways in which technology was used to touch people around the world. I entered the software space because I believe technical advancements can contribute solutions to societal. Combining my social lens with technical skills excites and motivates me.

I holds a BS in Diplomacy and World Affairs from Occidental College and graduated from Hackbright Academy, a 12 week intensive bootcamp that teaches programming and computer science fundamentals.
